        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>I am an 11th-grade student with a deep passion for computer science. Although I am still early in my academic journey, I have already developed a strong understanding of key programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. My curiosity about technology has driven me to explore a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, which I use to create web applications and explore new technologies.
            
            As a computer science student, I strive to stay up to date with the latest trends in the tech industry. My passion for learning and building innovative solutions motivates me to continuously improve and reach for excellence in everything I do. With my growing skills and dedication, I am excited about the future and eager to contribute to the tech world.</p>
